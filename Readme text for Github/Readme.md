<h2>Auto Text generator for Readme.md</h2>
<br>
Here I will make a programme to auto edit your readme file according what you have added in your directory.
<br>
You just want to copy link and then you have to run it.
<br>
Then it will automatically update your readme.md accordingly.
<br>
You need to give path of your readme file with proper name.
<br>
And also need to give path of directory.

Here I have always a file named a.exe which comes in last evertime
<br>
so I always take second last file as new file Because I never want to add a.exe in readme.
<br>

<b>NOTE: You should use numbering in nomeclature of a file.</b>
<br>
For Example if you have 100 file then you must name them like 001..., 002..., etc.
<br>
Because this will arrange the new added file in the last in your folder.
